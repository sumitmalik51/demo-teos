       - The name of the repository where the commit was made
       - The branch a commit was made in
       - The SHA1 of the commit, including a link to the diff in GitHub
       - The author of the commit
       - The date when the commit was made
       - The files that were changed as part of the commit
       - The commit message
       - You can filter email notifications you receive for pushes to a repository. For more information, see "Configuring notifications."
